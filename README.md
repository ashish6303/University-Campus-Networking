# University-Campus-Networking
Computer Communication -
This project is done under the Guidance of Dr B Hariharan.
In this we learn about how to design a suitable network system for universities in developing
countries. The aim was to design a network with high security and low cost. This project
will help to enhanced education of developing countries. The advantages of networking
can be seen clearly in terms of efficiency, security, manageability and cost as it allows
collaboration between users in a wide area. To improve college campus network design,
the technology used was creating LAN, WLAN and using cheap device to reduce cost of
the network. But the network can also become better using routing protocols and other
protocol. So, we are going to use such protocols using less number of devices and will
also maintain the cost of the network less. To design such network, we are going to use
software Cisco-Packet Tracer.
